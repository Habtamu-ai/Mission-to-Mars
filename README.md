# Mission-to-Mars
## Overview

The main purpose of this project is to build an interactive web app that can scrape, store and display the information we want instead of visiting each web and find information manually. The project uses  Chrome Developer Tools to identify HTML components for web scraping. To automate a web browser, scrape, and gather data the project uses the BeautifulSoup and Splinter. To store the scraped data we use the NoSQL Mongo database. Finally, the project creates a web application that updates itself using a flask to display the scraped and stored data.
